            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This project come to life after I struggled to keep track of the campaigns that I 
                was playing. It happened more than once of getting lost on what was done between 
                notes and pictures. Also trying to use a spreadsheet wasn't very helpfull because 
                I usually don't have a laptod around and spreadsheet isn't very mobile friendelly 
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why I create this page, I tried to create a easy way to keep track of your 
                board games by just accessing a page. And I also tried to build it focusing on mobile 
                user, because we have a high chance of someone carrying a phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have plans to include more games and continue improving this page, but that takes
                time. Also it's little complex to include a game that I didn't played and don't know 
                how the players keep track of the campaign. So if exists a game that you really wish 
                to be included you can head to the project Github 
                <a href="https://github.com/jdrcabral/boardgametracker">page</a> and create 
                an issue requesting that game. And if you know a little bit about coding, you can 
                create the game yourself and I will happily review your code and include you changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you are wondering about it becoming a mobile application, I have another project 
                for that. At the moment it isn't in a working stage and I at this moment I don't have 
                much time to work on it, but if you want to give a look at it you can see it 
                <a href="https://github.com/jdrcabral/bgcampaigntracker">here</a>.</p>
